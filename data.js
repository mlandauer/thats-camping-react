Over 140 km of walking tracks of all grades (some accessible for people with a disability) in diverse settings make the Blue Mountains a bushwalker's paradise.\n\nThis park, which is part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, protects an unusually diverse range of vegetation communities.

Its many and varied attractions include walks through alpine herbfields; spectacular caves and limestone gorges; scenic drives; and historic huts and homesteads.\n\nOne of the Australian Alps national parks, this park is nationally and internationally recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It contains nine wilderness areas, and its alpine and sub-alpine areas contain plant species found nowhere else in the world. The park is also home to the rare mountain pygmy possum and corroboree frog.\n\nThe northern section is famous for extensive treeless plains and historic huts. This is where you will find Selwyn Snowfields. The central section is home to Australia's largest alpine area: the place above the treeline, covered with delicate herbfields and fragile bogs and fens. This is where you'll find most of the park's ski fields - Perisher Blue, Thredbo and Charlotte Pass. The southern section offers dry, rugged areas along the lower Snowy River surrounded by large expanses of wilderness.\n\nWeather can change quickly in the mountains and snow can fall at any time of the year. Check how to get there for more information.\n\nKosciuszko Today, the seasonal Kosciuszko National Park Guide, provides up-to-date information about cross-country camping and picnic areas, cave tours, walking and cycling trails, ski trails and snow-shoeing, heritage accommodation and more.
